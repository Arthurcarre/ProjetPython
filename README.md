# ProjetPython - Protein Ligand Interactions Profiler

        Profiler is a class that allows the 3D pharmacophore of a protein-ligand complex to be established. 
        From a PDB code or a pathway, it extracts the ligand as well as the residues that constitute the 
        pocket. Profiler then builds the pharmacophore profile of the ligand and the pocket. 
        Finally, Profiler compares the two profiles to determine the electrostatic interactions that
        that would allow the complex to be stabilised.

Requirements, installation and usage are thoroughly documented in the [PIA Wiki](https://github.com/Arthurcarre/ChemoTools/wiki).
